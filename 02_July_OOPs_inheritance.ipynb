    "1.Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used?\n",
    "ans:In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (called the child or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called the parent or base class). This means that the child class can reuse code defined in the parent class without having to re-implement it.\n",
    "    Parent Class (Base Class): This is the class that provides the initial set of properties and methods that are inherited by other classes. It serves as a blueprint.\n",
    "    Child Class (Derived Class): This class inherits attributes and methods from its parent class. It can also extend or modify these attributes and methods, and add its own unique attributes and methods.\n",
    "    We can use inheritance when one class is a specialized version of another (e.g., Dog is a type of Animal)and Used to avoid duplicating code across multiple classes that share common attributes and behaviors.    "
